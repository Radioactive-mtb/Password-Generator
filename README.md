# The Password Generator

## Description

This is a web application that generates a random password for you. You can choose the length of your password between 8 and 128 characters. You can choose wether or not you want to include numbers, special characters, and upper and lowercase letters. I created this because I was tired of having to come up with unique passwords for all of my accounts.

1. click the generate password button on the page.
2. A prompt will appear asking you to input the length of the password.
3. A prompt will appear asking if you want to include numbers.
4. A prompt will appear asking if you want to include special characters.
5. A prompt will appear asking if you want to include lowercase letters.
6. A prompt will appear asking if you want to include uppercase letters.
7. Your new password will appear on the page.
